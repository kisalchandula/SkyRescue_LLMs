Bluesky Disaster Post Classifier

This project fetches posts from Bluesky, classifies them as disaster-related, and then extracts key disaster information (location, severity, reasoning) using a language model (Claude). It helps in identifying and processing disaster-related content from Bluesky to better understand the situation and aid in disaster response analysis.
